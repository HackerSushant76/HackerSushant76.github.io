            Hello! My name is Sushant and I enjoy creating things that live on
            the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2018
            when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out
            hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML &
            CSS! </p>
            <p>Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at
            an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
            student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
            accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
            Upstatement for a variety of clients. I also recently launched a
            course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the
            Spotify API using Node & React. Upstatement for a variety of
            clients.
